<h1 align="center">Cloud-Computing </h1>
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. Cloud computing offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

+ The cloud Computing is one of the main technologies that are being using in today’ most industries and Business.
+ It is   the web-based servers and software that can be accessed and used online. 
+ Customers  can use these systems from any location that has internet access.

<h1 align="center">The three main types of cloud distribution 
                                models 
 #

- **Private cloud computing**
It is use or designed to a single organization
Advantage enhanced security, control, and customization
Disadvantage is that requires more resources to management and maintain.

- **Public cloud computing**
Is accessible  and affordable over open internet
The customers don’t have to buying, managing, and maintaining their own IT infrastructure.

 - **Hybrid cloud computing**
 A hybrid cloud can offer the benefits of scalability, cost-efficiency, and flexibility of public clouds
Also maintaining the security, control, and performance of private clouds.

<h1 align="center">Types of cloud services


  
#

- **Infrastructure as a service (IaaS):** This layer provides the basic computing resources, such as servers, storage, networks, and operating systems, that can be rented on demand from a cloud provider.
- **Platform as a service (PaaS):** This layer provides a development environment and tools for building and deploying cloud-based applications, without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
- **Software as a service (SaaS):** This layer provides ready-to-use applications that run on the cloud, such as email, productivity, collaboration, and CRM software, that can be accessed through a web browser or a mobile app.
- **Function as a service (FaaS):** This layer provides a way to execute small pieces of code, called functions, in response to events or triggers, without having to provision or manage any servers or containers.

<h1 align="center"> Amazon Web Services (AWS)


 #
+ AWS is a leading provider of cloud computing services that enable users to access various resources over the public internet
+ AWS is a secure cloud platform, offering computer power, database, content delivery and other services to help business scale and grow.

#
<h1 align="center"> AWS offers three main products
  
  
  #

- **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud EC2**,which provides scalable virtual servers on demand in the Amazon Web Services Cloud.

- **Amazon Glacier** , which offers low-cost cloud storage for infrequently accessed data.

- **Amazon S3**, which delivers durable and highly available object storage.

<h1 align="center"> AWS Advantages
  
#
- **Cost Effective:** With AWS, the business only pays for the compute resources they use when someone visits their website. This can result in significant cost savings.
